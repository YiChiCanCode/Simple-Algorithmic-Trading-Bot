# Simple-Algorithmic-Trading-Bot
An algorithmic trading bot tradinig APPL based on Momentum Ignition Strategy.

## Project Description
I used to have no experience in tradinig bot, but the whole idea of high frequency trading is very fascinating to me, as I wonder how algorithms could be designed (as well other aspects like hardware, connection are set up) to optimize the trading process. As a result, I did this project to familarize myself with the process! The overall project is a APPL momentum-ignition-strategy-based HFT trading bot, built with C++.

## HFT (High Freqency Trading)
High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a trading strategy that involves executing a large number of trades within very short timeframes, often in milliseconds or microseconds. HFT is characterized by its speed, technology-driven approach, and the use of advanced algorithms to capitalize on small price movements and market inefficiencies. It has gained prominence in financial markets due to the rapid advancement of technology and the quest for competitive advantages.

## Momentum Ignition Strategy
The Momentum Ignition Strategy is a high-frequency trading (HFT) approach that aims to take advantage of building price momentum by rapidly entering trades that contribute to the momentum, potentially amplifying the price movement. This strategy capitalizes on the idea that price trends often gain momentum as more traders participate, and a well-timed trade can amplify the movement.
